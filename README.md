My First AI/ML Project – Fake News Detection

Hello! I’m excited to share my first AI/ML project, where I built a Fake News Detection Model using Python.

Project Overview This model is designed to classify news articles as real or fake using:

Vectorization – Converting text data into numerical format.
Logistic Regression – Applying a supervised learning algorithm for classification.
Tech Stack

Language:Python
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas
Concepts Used: Machine Learning
Why Python? Python is widely considered the core language for modern AI/ML models because of its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support.

This project marks my first step into the world of AI/ML, and I’m looking forward to exploring more complex models ahead!
